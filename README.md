# OpenAI_project
My first chatbot, an ultra-happy assistant, using OpenAI API

Current Progress:
1. Connect with OpenAI API, got chat working (test_openai.py);
2. Add ability to chat interactively with user input (OpenAI_interactive.py);
3. Add ability to store chat log and use chat log for context (OpenAI_interactive.py);
4. Add Dall-E 2 and use chat to generate prompt for Dall-E 2 to create a profile image for this assitant (test_openai.py); 
5. Add a hidden prompt so that the bot appears always happy and always trying to give out 3 jokes (OpenAI_interactive_UltraHappy.py);
6. Add a preliminary safety prompt and did a test using an exmaple from The Washington Post (OpenAI_interactive_UltraHappy.py);
7. Add the log to record bot's understanding of user context (OpenAI_interactive.py)
8. Add the ability to create user profile based on chat context (OpenAI_interactive.py)

More to come...
